# ECE5831-Final-Project

This research explores the practical applications of computer vision through ConvLSTM and LRCN models for human action recognition, revealing that ConvLSTM initially exhibits robustness but succumbs to overfitting, while LRCN consistently performs with high accuracy, precision, and recall. An external implementation integrates human action recognition and pose prediction. The study emphasizes the ethical responsibility of developing technology to assist those in need and discusses the transformative potential of computer vision. The literature review explores advancements in object and pose detection, highlighting ConvLSTM and LRCN architectures. The methodology details hyperparameters and design choices for ConvLSTM and LRCN models. Results indicate LRCN's reduced susceptibility to overfitting compared to ConvLSTM. Testing on unseen data shows challenges, and an external implementation combines human action recognition and pose prediction. Future improvements involve exploring sophisticated architectures, data augmentation, transfer learning, hyperparameter tuning, and addressing class imbalances for robust model deployment.
